# Coding Guidelines

Welcome to FlahaCalc! To ensure that our codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable, we follow these coding guidelines. Please adhere to these guidelines when contributing to the project:

## General Rules

- Use descriptive and meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep lines of code reasonably short (typically around 80 characters) to improve readability.
- Use spaces for indentation, not tabs. Set your editor to use spaces with a width of 2 or 4 spaces.
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or document important parts of the code.
- Remove commented-out code and debugging statements before submitting a pull request.

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Use semantic HTML elements whenever possible to improve accessibility and SEO.
- Organize CSS rules logically and consider using BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to maintain a consistent naming convention.
- Minimize the use of inline styles and prefer external CSS files.
- In JavaScript, use ES6 features when appropriate to improve code readability.
- Make sure to handle errors and edge cases gracefully to avoid unexpected behavior.

## File Organization

- Keep files and directories organized in a meaningful manner. Separate concerns and functionalities into different files as appropriate.
- Use lowercase letters for filenames and separate words with hyphens.

## Version Control and Pull Requests

- Always create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix. Name your branches descriptively (e.g., `feature/evapotranspiration-calculator`).
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix. Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.
- Write clear and detailed pull request descriptions, explaining the purpose of the changes and any considerations for reviewers.

## Code Review

- Be open to feedback and constructive criticism during code reviews. Treat code reviews as an opportunity for learning and improvement.
- Avoid taking feedback personally and always maintain a positive and respectful attitude during code review discussions.
