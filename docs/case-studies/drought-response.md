# Case Study: Drought Response Planning

## Overview

This case study examines how the Central Valley Water District used EVAPOTRAN to develop and implement a comprehensive drought response plan during a severe multi-year drought.

## Client Profile

**Organization**: Central Valley Water District (CVWD)
**Location**: Central Valley, California, USA
**Service Area**: 850,000 acres of agricultural land and 12 municipalities
**Water Sources**: Surface water (65%), groundwater (35%)
**Previous Approach**: Historical allocation based on water rights seniority

## Challenges

1. **Limited Water Supply**: Reservoir levels at 28% of capacity and declining groundwater tables
2. **Competing Demands**: Agricultural, municipal, and environmental water needs in conflict
3. **Economic Concerns**: Potential for significant crop losses and economic damage
4. **Equity Issues**: Need for fair distribution of limited water resources
5. **Long-term Planning**: Uncertainty about drought duration and future water availability

## Implementation

1. **Regional ET₀ Mapping**: Created high-resolution evapotranspiration maps across the district
2. **Crop Water Need Assessment**: Calculated water requirements for different crops and growth stages
3. **Allocation Modeling**: Developed water allocation scenarios based on ET₀ data
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Established continuous monitoring of climate conditions and water use
5. **Public Information System**: Created dashboards for water users to track allocations and usage

## Results

After implementation:

1. **Water Conservation**: 24% reduction in total water use across the district
2. **Economic Protection**: Preserved 87% of agricultural production value despite 35% less water
3. **Equitable Distribution**: Transparent, needs-based water allocation accepted by stakeholders
4. **Compliance**: Met all state-mandated water reduction targets
5. **Improved Planning**: Better long-term forecasting of water needs and availability

## Key Insights

1. **Spatial Variability**: Significant ET₀ differences across the district influenced allocation efficiency
2. **Crop Selection Impact**: Data-driven decisions about which crops to prioritize minimized economic losses
3. **Timing Sensitivity**: Precise timing of limited irrigation based on growth stages maximized efficiency
4. **Communication Importance**: Transparent data sharing reduced conflicts between water users
5. **Adaptive Management**: Regular recalculation of ET₀ allowed for adjustments as conditions changed

## Conclusion

The Central Valley Water District's implementation of EVAPOTRAN for drought response demonstrates how scientific evapotranspiration data can transform water management during scarcity, achieving more equitable and economically efficient distribution of limited resources.
