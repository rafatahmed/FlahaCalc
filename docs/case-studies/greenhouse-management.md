# Case Study: Greenhouse Management

## Overview

This case study examines how EVAPOTRAN optimized irrigation and climate control in a commercial greenhouse operation in Valencia, Spain.

## Client Profile

**Organization**: GreenHarvest Farms
**Location**: Valencia, Spain
**Operation Size**: 2.5 hectares of greenhouse space
**Crops**: Tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers
**Previous System**: Timer-based irrigation with manual adjustments

## Challenges

1. **Inconsistent Irrigation**: Timer-based irrigation didn't account for changing weather
2. **High Water Usage**: Excessive water application during cooler periods
3. **Climate Control Inefficiency**: HVAC systems running unnecessarily
4. **Crop Stress**: Plants showing signs of water stress despite regular irrigation
5. **Energy Costs**: High energy consumption for climate control

## Implementation

1. **Weather Station Integration**: Connected local weather station data
2. **Daily ET₀ Calculations**: Automated daily calculation of reference evapotranspiration
3. **Crop Coefficient Application**: Applied specific crop coefficients
4. **Irrigation System Connection**: Linked EVAPOTRAN outputs to automated irrigation controllers
5. **Climate Control Integration**: Used ET₀ data to inform HVAC system operation

## Results

After six months:

1. **Water Savings**: 27% reduction in total water usage
2. **Energy Efficiency**: 18% reduction in climate control energy consumption
3. **Crop Yield**: 12% increase in tomato yield, 9% increase in cucumber yield
4. **Quality Improvement**: Reduced incidence of blossom end rot by 65%
5. **Labor Efficiency**: 15 hours per week saved in manual system adjustments

## Key Insights

1. **Microclimate Variations**: Significant ET₀ variations within different greenhouse zones
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Clear patterns in daily ET₀ that could be anticipated
3. **Crop-Specific Responses**: Different crops showed varying sensitivity to ET₀-based irrigation
4. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Crop coefficients needed seasonal adjustment for optimal results

## Conclusion

The implementation of EVAPOTRAN at GreenHarvest Farms demonstrates how precision evapotranspiration calculation can significantly improve greenhouse operations, leading to water and energy savings while improving crop yield and quality. The case study highlights the importance of:

1. **Data-Driven Irrigation**: Moving beyond timer-based systems to weather-responsive irrigation
2. **Integration Capabilities**: Connecting evapotranspiration data with control systems
3. **Visualization Tools**: Using visual data representation to identify patterns and anomalies
4. **Crop-Specific Approach**: Tailoring water management to specific crop needs

For greenhouse operations looking to optimize resource use and improve crop outcomes, EVAPOTRAN provides a scientific foundation for precision irrigation management.
