# Case Studies

This section presents real-world applications of EVAPOTRAN in various agricultural and water management scenarios. These case studies demonstrate how the tool can be used to solve practical problems and improve decision-making.

## Available Case Studies

1. [Vineyard Irrigation Optimization](vineyard-irrigation.md)
2. [Greenhouse Water Management](greenhouse-management.md)
3. [Urban Landscape Planning](urban-landscape.md)
4. [Drought Response Planning](drought-response.md)
5. [Seasonal Crop Water Requirements](seasonal-crop-water.md)

Each case study includes:

- Background information
- Problem statement
- Data collection methodology
- Analysis using EVAPOTRAN
- Results and outcomes
- Lessons learned

## How to Use These Case Studies

These case studies can serve as:

1. **Learning tools** to understand how evapotranspiration calculations apply to real situations
2. **Templates** for your own analysis
3. **Validation** of the EVAPOTRAN methodology
4. **Inspiration** for new applications
