# Case Study: Urban Landscape Management

## Overview

This case study examines how the Parks Department of Westlake City used EVAPOTRAN to optimize irrigation in urban parks and landscaped areas, resulting in significant water conservation and improved landscape health.

## Client Profile

**Organization**: Westlake City Parks Department
**Location**: Westlake City, California, USA
**Managed Area**: 450 acres of parks, medians, and public landscapes
**Landscape Types**: Mixed turf, native plantings, ornamental gardens, and street trees
**Previous System**: Zone-based irrigation with seasonal scheduling

## Challenges

The Parks Department faced several challenges in managing urban landscapes:

1. **Water Restrictions**: Severe drought conditions led to municipal water restrictions
2. **Budget Constraints**: Limited budget for irrigation system upgrades
3. **Diverse Landscape Needs**: Different plant types requiring varied irrigation approaches
4. **Public Scrutiny**: Visible brown spots in parks leading to public complaints
5. **Staff Limitations**: Small maintenance team managing large areas

## Implementation

The Parks Department implemented EVAPOTRAN as part of a water conservation initiative:

1. **Weather Station Network**: Installed five weather stations across the city
2. **Landscape Zoning**: Categorized landscape areas by plant type and microclimate
3. **ET₀ Integration**: Connected EVAPOTRAN to the central irrigation control system
4. **Staff Training**: Trained maintenance staff on ET₀-based irrigation principles
5. **Public Dashboard**: Created a public-facing dashboard showing water conservation efforts

## Technical Setup

The technical implementation included:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Weather stations measuring temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed
   - Flow meters on main irrigation lines
   - Soil moisture sensors in representative landscape zones

2. **EVAPOTRAN Configuration**:
   - Daily ET₀ calculations for each weather station zone
   - Plant factor adjustments for different landscape types
   - Irrigation efficiency factors for different system types

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Direct API connection to Rainbird central control system
   - Mobile app for maintenance staff
   - Public website with water usage visualization

## Results

After one year of implementation, the Parks Department achieved:

1. **Water Reduction**: 32% decrease in total landscape water use
2. **Cost Savings**: $245,000 annual reduction in water bills
3. **Landscape Quality**: Improved plant health despite using less water
4. **Compliance**: Met all municipal water restriction requirements
5. **Public Perception**: Positive feedback on landscape appearance and conservation efforts

## Key Insights

The implementation revealed several important insights:

1. **Microclimate Impact**: Significant ET₀ variations across the city due to urban heat island effects
2. **System Efficiency**: Irrigation system efficiency varied widely across different parks
3. **Plant Adaptation**: Native plants adjusted quickly to precision irrigation scheduling
4. **Soil Variations**: Different soil types required adjustments to irrigation run times
5. **Public Education**: Visualization tools helped educate the public about water conservation

## Visualization Impact

The visualization tools in EVAPOTRAN played a crucial role in the success of this project:

1. **ET₀ Heatmaps**: Spatial visualization of evapotranspiration rates across the city helped identify microclimates and prioritize irrigation zones
2. **Water Usage Dashboards**: Real-time and historical water usage displays helped staff monitor conservation progress
3. **Comparison Tools**: Side-by-side comparison of different irrigation strategies helped optimize scheduling
4. **Public Portal**: Simplified visualizations for public education increased community support

## Implementation Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during implementation:

1. **Weather Station Placement**: Finding optimal locations for weather stations in urban environments
2. **Staff Adoption**: Overcoming resistance to new technology among maintenance staff
3. **System Integration**: Connecting with legacy irrigation controllers required custom interfaces
4. **Data Management**: Handling the volume of data from multiple weather stations
5. **Calibration**: Adjusting crop coefficients for ornamental and mixed plantings

## Long-term Maintenance

To ensure continued success, the Parks Department established:

1. **Regular Calibration**: Quarterly review and adjustment of weather sensors
2. **Staff Training Program**: Ongoing training for new and existing staff
3. **Data Backup Protocol**: Automated backup of all historical weather and irrigation data
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monthly review of water usage and landscape health metrics
5. **Technology Updates**: Annual review of system components and software updates

## Future Plans

Based on the success of this implementation, the Parks Department is planning:

1. **Expanded Coverage**: Adding more weather stations to cover additional parks
2. **Smart Irrigation Controllers**: Upgrading to controllers with direct ET₀ integration
3. **Soil Moisture Integration**: Adding more soil moisture sensors for feedback-based irrigation
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing forecasting to anticipate irrigation needs
5. **Regional Collaboration**: Sharing data with neighboring municipalities

## Conclusion

The Westlake City Parks Department's implementation of EVAPOTRAN demonstrates how science-based irrigation management can significantly improve urban landscape sustainability. By basing irrigation decisions on actual evapotranspiration data rather than fixed schedules, the department achieved substantial water savings while maintaining or improving landscape quality.

This case study highlights the importance of:

1. **Microclimate Awareness**: Recognizing and accounting for local climate variations
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Using actual ET₀ measurements rather than estimates
3. **Staff Engagement**: Ensuring maintenance personnel understand and support the system
4. **Public Communication**: Sharing conservation efforts with the community
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reviewing and optimizing the system

For urban landscape managers facing water restrictions and budget constraints, EVAPOTRAN offers a proven solution for balancing conservation goals with aesthetic requirements.
