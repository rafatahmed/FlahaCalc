# Weather Visualization

The Weather Visualization module allows you to generate visual representations of climate data and evapotranspiration results.

## Accessing Weather Visualization

There are two ways to access the visualization tools:

1. From the EVAPOTRAN home page, click on "Weather Visualization"
2. After uploading an EPW file, click "View Weather Heatmaps"

## Available Visualization Types

### 1. Heatmaps

Heatmaps display data using color intensity across a grid, typically showing:

- Daily values across months (12×31 grid)
- Hourly values across days (24×31 grid)
- Monthly averages across years (for multi-year datasets)

Available heatmap parameters include:
- Temperature (min, max, average)
- Relative humidity
- Solar radiation
- Wind speed
- Calculated ET₀

### 2. Time Series Charts

Time series charts show how values change over time:

- Daily values for a selected month
- Monthly averages for a year
- Hourly values for a selected day

### 3. Comparison Charts

Compare different parameters or time periods:

- ET₀ vs. temperature
- ET₀ vs. solar radiation
- Current year vs. historical averages

## Creating Visualizations

### Generating a Heatmap

1. Select "Heatmap" from the visualization type dropdown
2. Choose the parameter you want to visualize
3. Select the time scale (hourly, daily, monthly)
4. Click "Generate Visualization"
5. Adjust color scale and display options as needed

### Creating Time Series Charts

1. Select "Time Series" from the visualization type dropdown
2. Choose the parameter(s) you want to plot
3. Select the time period
4. Click "Generate Chart"
5. Use the toolbar to zoom, pan, or export the chart

## Customizing Visualizations

You can customize your visualizations with these options:

- **Color Schemes**: Choose from predefined color palettes or create custom schemes
- **Scale Range**: Set minimum and maximum values for the color scale
- **Labels**: Add custom titles, axis labels, and annotations
- **Grid Lines**: Toggle grid lines on/off and adjust their appearance
- **Legend Position**: Move the legend to different positions on the chart

## Exporting Visualizations

Export your visualizations in various formats:

1. **Image Formats**: PNG, JPG, SVG
2. **Data Export**: CSV, JSON
3. **Print-Ready PDF**: Generate a report with visualizations and metadata

## Interpreting Visualizations

### Reading Heatmaps

- **Color Intensity**: Darker colors typically represent higher values
- **Patterns**: Look for seasonal patterns, daily cycles, and anomalies
- **Gradients**: Observe how values transition between time periods

### Understanding ET₀ Patterns

Typical patterns you might observe:
- Higher ET₀ during summer months
- Peak ET₀ during midday hours
- Correlation between ET₀ and solar radiation
- Inverse relationship between ET₀ and humidity
