# Introduction to EVAPOTRAN

EVAPOTRAN is a comprehensive tool for calculating reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) using the FAO Penman-Monteith method. This guide will help you understand what EVAPOTRAN is and how it can benefit your agricultural water management practices.

## What is Evapotranspiration?

Evapotranspiration (ET) is the combined process of water evaporation from soil and plant surfaces and transpiration from plants. Reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) represents the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface, not short of water.
